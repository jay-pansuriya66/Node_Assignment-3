## How to Use

### Option 1: Using Batch File (Easiest)
1. Double-click `CREATE_PDF.bat`
2. The script will:
   - Check if Python is installed
   - Install Pillow library if needed
   - Create the PDF
3. Find the output file: `Assignment_3_Screenshots.pdf`

### Option 2: Using Python Directly
```bash
# Install Pillow if not already installed
pip install Pillow

# Run the script
python create_pdf.py
```

## Requirements
- **Python 3.6+** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Pillow library** - Automatically installed by batch file

## Output
- **Filename:** `Assignment_3_Screenshots.pdf`
- **Location:** Same directory as the script
- **Contents:** All PNG screenshots in specified order
- **Quality:** High quality (95% compression)

## Features
- âœ… Automatic PNG to RGB conversion
- âœ… Handles transparent backgrounds (converts to white)
- âœ… Maintains image quality
- âœ… Sequential page order
- âœ… Error handling for missing images
- âœ… File size optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Python Not Found
```
Error: Python is not installed or not in PATH
```
**Solution:** Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### Pillow Installation Failed
```
Error: Failed to install Pillow
```
**Solution:** Run Command Prompt as Administrator and try:
```bash
pip install Pillow --user
```

### Images Not Found
```
Warning: The following images were not found
```
**Solution:** Make sure all PNG files are in the Assignment_3 directory.
The script will create a PDF with whatever images it can find.

### PDF Too Large
If the PDF file is too large (>10MB), you can reduce quality by editing `create_pdf.py`:
```python
# Change this line (around line 87)
quality=95,  # Reduce to 85 or 75
```

## Manual PDF Creation (Alternative)

If Python is not available, you can use online tools:

1. **Smallpdf**: https://smallpdf.com/jpg-to-pdf
2. **ILovePDF**: https://www.ilovepdf.com/jpg_to_pdf
3. **PDF24**: https://tools.pdf24.org/en/images-to-pdf

Upload images in the order specified above.
